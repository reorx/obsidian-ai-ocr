# Test Assets Directory

Place your test files in this directory. The OCR test will process all supported files found here.

## Supported File Types

- Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- PDFs

## Notes

- Test files are not included in the repository to avoid copyright issues and keep the repository size manageable
- Add your own files here for testing purposes
- Files should be relatively small for testing (ideally under 5MB)
- For optimal testing, include files with both text and images
